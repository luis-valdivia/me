# My Personal Website

Clone the repo, then install dependencies with
```bash
$ npm install
```
then serve with hot reload at localhost:3000 with
```bash
$ npm run dev
```
To build, run 
```bash
$ npm run build
```
and then make it live however you like. I'm using surge, so I need to cd into /dist to run 
```bash
$ surge
```
to make it live.
